**Content:**

This repository contains model settings and documentation ([readthedocs](http://eccov4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) that allow users to download, analyze, rerun, or modify ECCO version 4 ocean state estimates using the [MITgcm](http://mitgcm.org/) via on-premise computers or [cloud-computing recipes](example_scripts/README.md)). Model output can be analyzed and manipulated using the [gcmfaces][] and [MITprof][] toolboxes in `Matlab / Octave`. Other toolboxes are available in `Python` and `Julia`. For user support, please contact <mitgcm-support@mit.edu> or <ecco-support@mit.edu>.

**ECCO version 4 release 2:** 

[Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean][] version 4 release 2 is an ocean state estimate and solution of the [MIT general circulation model][] that covers the period from 1992 to 2011 (Forget et al., 2016). It is a minor update of the original ECCO version 4 solution (Forget et al., 2015) that benefits from a few additional corrections listed in Forget et al. (2016) and is easier to analyze and re-run. Its input and output are available for direct download from [Dataverse][]. 

Other ECCOv4 solutions: see `Other known solutions` in the [documentation](https://eccov4.readthedocs.io)
