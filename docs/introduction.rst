Introduction
************

ECCO version 4 is an ocean state estimate and solution of the MIT general circulation model (`MITgcm`).

ECCO V4 release 2 (or `V4r2`) covers the period from 1992 to 2011 :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`. 

It was the first update to the original solution of :cite:`for-eta:15` that 

#. benefits from a few additional corrections listed in :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`

#. is provided with additional model-data misfit and model budget output

#. is easier to rerun than ECCO version 4 release 1


The :ref:`downloads` section provides an installation guide and links to various analysis tools. 

The :ref:`runs` section provides simple instructions to reproduce the model simulation in the cloud or on a local computer.

This can be useful to generate additional output, prepare a new experiment with the model, etc.
