ECCO version 4 is an ocean state estimate and solution of the MIT general circulation model (`MITgcm`).
ECCO V4 release 2 (or `V4r2`) covers the period from 1992 to 2011 :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`. 

⏩️ :ref:`downloads` for an installation guide and links to analysis tools. 

⏩️ :ref:`runs` for simple instructions to reproduce the model simulation. 

.. note::

   Reproducing the model simulationthe model simulation (in the cloud or locally) enables you to generate additional output, prepare a new experiment with the model, etc.

.. note::

    V4r2 was the first update to the original ECCO V4 solution :cite:`for-eta:15` with : 

    #. additional corrections listed in :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`
    #. additional model-data misfit and model budget output
    #. easier to rerun than ECCO version 4 release 1
