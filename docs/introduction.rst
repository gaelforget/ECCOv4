ECCO version 4 is an ocean state estimate and solution of the MIT general circulation model (`MITgcm`).
ECCO V4 release 2 (or `V4r2`) covers the period from 1992 to 2011 :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`. 
It was the first update to the original solution of :cite:`for-eta:15` with a few small improvements: 

#. additional corrections listed in :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`

#. additional model-data misfit and model budget output

#. easier to rerun than ECCO version 4 release 1

-  :ref:`runs` for simple instructions to reproduce the model simulation (*). 

Note

* In the cloud or on a local computer. To generate additional output, prepare a new experiment with the model, etc.
