#. benefits from a few additional corrections listed in :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`

#. has become easier to rerun than ECCO version 4 release 1. 


The :ref:`downloads` section provides an installation guide and links to various analysis tools. The :ref:`runs` section provides simple instructions to rerun model solutions, which can be useful to generate additional output for example, and start experimenting with the model.
