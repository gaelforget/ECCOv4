The `ECCO v4 r2` state estimate output is permanently archived within the `Harvard Dataverse <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ECCOv4r2>`__ that provides citable identifiers for the various datasets as reported in this `README.pdf <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/2863409>`__. For direct download purposes, see `Dataverse.jl <https://github.com/gdcc/Dataverse.jl#readme>`__.

Note : the ``nctiles_`` directory prefix indicates that contents are provided on the native LLC90 grid in the nctiles format :cite:`for-eta:15` which can be read in `Matlab` using the `gcmfaces` toolbox (see :numref:`download-analysis`). Alternatively users can download interpolated fields, on a :math:`1/2\times1/2^\circ` grid in the netcdf format, from the ``interp_*`` directories. The ``input_*`` directories contain binary and netcdf input files that can be read by `MITgcm` (:numref:`eccov4-baseline`). The ``profiles/`` directory additionally contains the MITprof, netcdf collections of collocated in situ and state estimate profiles :cite:`for-eta:15`.
